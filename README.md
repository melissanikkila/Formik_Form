# Installation
1. Fork the files from this repository.
2. Open a command line on your computer and run the command cd path/to/project/root, which allows you to point to the root folder of the starter files (note that      path/to/project/root should be replaced with the actual path to the forked files)
3. Within the same command-line window, run npm install to install all dependencies
4. Once the command completes successfully, run npm start to start the application in your browser.

# Usage
This is a common form that is seen across a variety of webpages that require a user to log into an account.  It utilizes React and Formik to create concise and easy to read code.

# Roadmap
I intend to update this file to contain CSS code that alters the apperiance of the button and fonts/colors.
